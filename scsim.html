        <h2>Client</h2>
        <p>Southern California of Information Management (SCSIM) is the largest IT leadership association in California, dedicating to advancing IT excellence in leadership. SCSIM offers a collaborative environment in which members can learn from colleagues, esteemed guest speakers and respected thought leaders</p>
        
        <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p>SCSIM wants to redesign and configure its website on new platforms in order to create a better environment for members to use its services and connect to other members</p>
        
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>4 months</p>
        
        <h2>Team</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cindy Chen - Project Manager</li>
            <li>Michael Zarour - Product Manager</li>
            <li>Phuc Nguyen - UI/UX Lead</li>
            <li>Qifan Zheng - UI/UX Assistant</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>Stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis, persona creation, visual design, desktop design from sketches to prototypes</p>
        
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>Pen, Paper, Marker, Whiteboard, Google Forms, Sketch, Adobe Xd, Figma, HTML, CSS, Higher Logic</p>
        
        <h1>First Steps</h1>
        <p>This is my Senior Capstone Project before I graduate from my undergraduate career at UCI on September 2018. I was put together into a group of three other seniors who are strangers. We were then assigned to the SCSIM project based on our preferences. Initially, we were given an old SCSIM website, built from the Wordpress platform, and some user feedback. The task was to build a more user friendly and responsive website for the client.</p>
        
        <h2>Process</h2>
        
        <img src="img/SCSIM_process.png" alt="SCSIM_process.png">
        
        <h2>User Feedback</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>"The <strong>website is not user friendly</strong> and does not provide a method to network or collaborate with other members."</em></li>
            
            <br>
            
            <li><em>"It would be good...if the forum or materials were available on the website as well as discussion forums, chat and blog capabilities for us to communicate with the board members. <strong>It (the website) is dated</strong> and often not current."</em></li>
            
            <br>
            
            <li><em>"Additionally, I am <strong>not getting value from the SIM website</strong> and/or it is redundant to information I am receiving from other sources."</em></li>
        
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Evaluation of Current Website</h2>
        <p>My team and I began the project by observing the current website with four pairs of fresh eyes without any biases. After evaluating the website, we learned that it not only reaffirmed SCSIM's concerns that the website's interface is dated and uninspiring but also the website is very lacking in terms of content. Another big concern we concluded is that for an IT-driven association, the website doesn't help convince IT leaders to want to join the group.</p>
        
        <h2>Stakeholder Interviews</h2>
        <p>My team and I conducted interviews with the Marketing Chair of SCSIM, Thomas Phelps, and the Event Chair, Jake Westphal. We discussed the projevy requirements, deliverables, and the aspects of the website that needed the most improvement: making the website to look more visually appealing and generating new, interesting content to get more members to engage with the website.</p>
        
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>We researched several direct competitors including SIM San Diego, UCLA IS Assosiates, Tech Council of Southern California, and Association of Information Technology Professional, and we discovered that all of these websites have a strong identity, provide easy to find and useful content, and are visually appealing. For our indirect competitors we looked at event managements such as eventbrite and Meetup to get a better understanding on how to manage and market SCSIM events effectively. Lastly, I suggested to research competitors who do the same service but with different population groups. We took notes of the features that are appealing and the ones that should be avoided so we could improve the SCSIM website.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>To get an understanding of our users, my team and I interviewed 4 potential users about their roles in their company and their membership with SCSIM. We used the result of these interviews to create four personas: Maira, a Chief Information Officer and our primary persona; Jonathan, a vendor; Palak, a project manager.</p>

        <h1>Ideation</h1>
        
        <h2>Feature Priorization</h2>
        <p>After the research was finished, we create a list of possible features of the new SCSIM website with our client and then narrow down to the essential features based on the goals and needs of our personas to create our MVP (Minimum Viable Product).</p>

        <p class="text-secondary text-center">A list of features of our MVP</p>
        
        <h2>Rough Sketches</h2>
        <p>Each member of the team individually sketched out possible screens for the SCSIM website interface.Together, we reviewed the sketches and then combined the best aspects of each into one design.</p>
        
        <h1>Lo-fi Prototype &#38 Testing</h1>
        
        <h2>Wireframes &#38 Lo-fi Prototypes</h2>
        <p>With the basic features and layouts settled, I set up shared projects for the team using Figma while we used to collaborate on creating wireframes from our sketches. Michael and I led the design of the desktop layout.</p>
        
        <h2>Usability Feedback</h2>
        <p>For this project, we did not do any usability testing personally due to the time constraint, but we did receive feedback from our client and other IT leaders on our layout design.</p>
        
        <p>One notable changes we made was to include an additional feature, a featured article, that changes throughout every few months so that members can have an incentive to come back to the home page.</p>

        <h1>Hi-Fi Prototyping &#38 Configuration</h1>
        
        <h2>Hi-Fi Mockups &#38 Prototypes</h2>
        <p>Using our refined wireframes and feedback, we created high-fidelity mockups on Adobe Xd. Because Adobe Xd does not have a collaborative feature, we each assigned and worked on the mockups individualy and came together to make the layout consistent.

        </div>
        
        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>After we got approval from our client on our mockups, we built the new SCSIM website on the Higher Logic platform. There were many limitations of the platform. A big problem was that we did not have the access to the CSS of the pre-made layouts and wrappers; consequently, there were some design features that we could not implemented due to the restrictions of the format. We mostly used HTML and a bit of CSS to work around the limitations of the platform.</p>
        
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Despite the limitations of the platform, we were able to design and configure the website to the best of our vision. In the end, our client was really happy with our end-product in which <strong>our design is currently being used a model website for future SIM chapters to follow.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The biggest lesson I learned during this project was the importance of being flexible. I did not expect that the Higher Logic platform to be so restricted, but my team and I worked around it to create the best website for our client. In regards to our client, he provided a lot valuable feedback and we also learned to be susceptible to both the positive and negative feedback.</p>
